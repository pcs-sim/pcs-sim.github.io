Coarse cloth models provide the interactive performance required by designers, but they can not be simulated at higher resolutions (“up-resed”) without introducing simulation artifacts and/or unpredicted outcomes, such as different folds, wrinkles and drapes. But how can a coarse simulation predict the result of an unconstrained, high-resolution simulation that has not yet been run?
We propose Progressive Cloth Simulation (PCS), a new forward simulation method for efficient preview of cloth quasistatics on exceedingly coarse triangle meshes with consistent and progressive improvement over a hierarchy of increasingly higher-resolution models. PCS provides an efficient coarse previewing simulation method that predicts the coarse-scale folds and wrinkles that will be generated by a corresponding converged, high-fidelity C-IPC simulation of the cloth drape’s equilibrium. For each preview PCS can generate an increasing-resolution sequence of consistent models that progress towards this converged solution. This successive improvement can then be interrupted at any point, for example, whenever design parameters are updated. PCS then ensures feasibility at all resolutions, so that predicted solutions remain intersection-free and capture the complex folding and buckling behaviors of frictionally contacting cloth.

<h5><b>Animation Design of "Sky Dancers" with Progressive Dynamics:</b> (Left) With Progressive Dynamics's efficient, coarsest-level previewing, artists quickly explore a wide palette of physical design parameters (e.g., material, layout, wind forcing) to produce numerous variations of a "Sky Dancers" animation concept. Once finalized in preview, we refine the selected animation (green-boxed) to higher-resolutions (Right) maintaining the overall physical behavior of the animation while progressively enriching it with finer-scale rich dynamic wrinkling behaviors. (Bottom) The finest-level solution elevates the selected coarse-scale preview to a final, polished, high-quality animation ready for screen display that preserves the preview's physical narrative.</h5>

  We propose Progressive Dynamics, a coarse-to-fine, level-of-detail simulation method for the physics-based animation of complex frictionally contacting thin shell and cloth dynamics. Progressive Dynamics provides tight-matching consistency and progressive improvement across levels, with comparable quality and realism to high-fidelity, IPC-based shell simulations [Li et al. 2021] at finest resolutions. Together these features enable an efficient animation-design pipeline with predictive coarse-resolution previews providing rapid design iterations for a final, to-be-generated, high-resolution animation. In contrast, previously, to design such scenes with comparable dynamics would require prohibitively slow design iterations via repeated direct simulations on high-resolution meshes. We evaluate and demonstrate Progressive Dynamics's features over a wide range of challenging stress-tests, benchmarks, and animation design tasks. Here Progressive Dynamics efficiently computes consistent previews at costs comparable to coarsest-level direct simulations. Its matching progressive refinements across levels then generate rich, high-resolution animations with high-speed dynamics, impacts, and the complex detailing of the dynamic wrinkling, folding, and sliding of frictionally contacting thin shells and fabrics.
